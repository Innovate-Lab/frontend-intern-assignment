## Objective
Your task is to create a web application with the following features using a framework of your choice (e.g., React, Next.js) and demonstrate your understanding of blockchain concepts, wallet integration, and interaction with a blockchain test network.

## Feature Requirements

### Must Have
- [ ] **Connect to Wallet**  
  Implement a simple interface that allows users to easily connect their blockchain wallet. Users should be able to select from a list of available wallets (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect, or any wallet supported by your chosen blockchain network).

- [ ] **Show Connected Account (Address)**  
  Display the user's wallet address in a clear and intuitive way. Ensure that this information updates dynamically when the user connects or switches accounts.

### Nice to Have

- [ ] **Initialize Client to Connect to the Network**  
  Set up a client to connect to the blockchain network, specifically a **testnet**. Ensure that connecting to the network is seamless and provides feedback to the user if the connection is successful or fails.

- [ ] **Fetch & Show Balance for Connected Account**  
  Retrieve and display the account balance of the connected wallet. 
  
- [ ] **Build a Form to Transfer Balance**  
  Create a simple and intuitive form where users can:
  - Enter the **destination address**.
  - Specify the **amount to transfer**.
  
  Include necessary validation to ensure that the input data is correct (e.g., valid address format, sufficient balance).

- [ ] **Check Transaction Status**  
  Provide feedback to the user about the status of their transaction, specifically:
  - **Finalized**: When the transaction is finalized on the blockchain.
  
  This feature should inform the user about the transaction's progress in a user-friendly way.

- [ ] **Check Transaction Result**  
  Clearly show whether the transaction was **successful** or **not**. Include error messages or confirmations for better user understanding.
